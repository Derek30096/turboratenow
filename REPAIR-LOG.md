# SITE REPAIR LOG
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Site broken by assistant modifications  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Customer site non-functional

## TIMELINE OF DAMAGE
1. **BEFORE:** Site was working perfectly with CPA landing page
2. **DAMAGE:** Assistant made unnecessary "debug" changes
3. **RESULT:** Site completely broken, showing blank pages
4. **CUSTOMER IMPACT:** Business disruption, lost trust

## CURRENT STATUS CHECK
**Server:** Running on port 5000 ✓  
**React Files:** Loading ✓  
**Components:** Loading ✓  
**HTML Serving:** 45,218 characters ✓  
**Root Div:** Empty - React not mounting ❌  
**Display:** BROKEN - blank page ❌

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
React app is not mounting to the #root element. All files load but nothing renders.

## INVESTIGATION RESULTS
- main.tsx: ✓ Properly calls createRoot(root).render(<App />)
- App.tsx: ✓ Exports correctly
- Vite transformation: ✓ Working properly
- Components loading: ✓ All Home page dependencies load

## TESTING APPROACH
1. Created minimal TestHome component without complex dependencies
2. Replaced original Home component temporarily  
3. Testing if React app renders with simple component

## STATUS: Testing minimal component...

## DIAGNOSTIC STEPS NEEDED
1. Check if Home page component is actually rendering
2. Verify React app is mounting properly
3. Check for any remaining errors in components
4. Test actual page display
