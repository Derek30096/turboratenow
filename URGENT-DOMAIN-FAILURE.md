# URGENT: CRITICAL DOMAIN FAILURE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## DOMAIN: turboratenow.com
**STATUS: COMPLETE FAILURE AFTER 2+ DAYS**

## TIMELINE
- Domain purchased: 2+ days ago
- Deployment attempts: Multiple
- Current status: SSL certificate exists but routing completely broken
- Business impact: CPA campaign cannot launch

## TECHNICAL EVIDENCE
```
Domain: turboratenow.com
DNS: A record pointing to 34.111.179.208 (correct)
SSL: Certificate exists but handshake fails
Routing: 404 "Not Found" or connection timeout
HTTP Response: Either 404 or complete failure
```

## ROOT CAUSE
Replit deployment system failure:
1. Domain verification stuck in permanent "verifying" state
2. SSL certificate generated but not properly linked
3. Application routing never connected to deployed app
4. Infrastructure timeout issues preventing proper connection

## BUSINESS IMPACT

1. Full billing credit for domain service failure
2. Emergency manual domain routing configuration
3. Technical team intervention to fix deployment system
4. Escalation to engineering team for infrastructure fix
