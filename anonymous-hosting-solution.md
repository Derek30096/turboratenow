# ANONYMOUS HOSTING SOLUTION

## CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE
Current worker URL exposes personal name: bingham-derek.workers.dev
This violates competitive security requirements for CPA campaigns.

## CLOUDFLARE SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Custom Domain for Workers
- Route turboratenow.net directly to worker (bypassing subdomain)
- Requires Workers Route configuration in Cloudflare
- Completely hides worker subdomain

### Option 2: Page Rules Redirect
- Set up redirect from turboratenow.net to an anonymous external service
- Use services like Netlify, Vercel with anonymous URLs

### Option 3: Alternative Anonymous Hosting
- Deploy to Vercel with anonymous project name
- Use Netlify with generic project name
- GitHub Pages with anonymous repository

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION NEEDED
Configure Cloudflare Workers Route for turboratenow.net to serve worker content directly without exposing the bingham-derek subdomain.

## STEPS FOR WORKERS ROUTE
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → turboratenow.net
2. Navigate to Workers & Pages → Routes
3. Add route: turboratenow.net/* → auto-rates-comparison worker
4. This serves worker content on custom domain without exposing subdomain
