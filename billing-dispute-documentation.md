# BILLING DISPUTE - REPLIT DOMAIN SERVICE FAILURE

## CUSTOMER IMPACT STATEMENT
**Domain:** turboratenow.com  
**Service Purchased:** Replit Custom Domain  
**Service Period:** 2+ days of complete failure  
**Business Impact:** Critical CPA marketing campaign delayed, revenue loss

## SERVICE FAILURE TIMELINE
- **Day 1:** Domain purchased through Replit platform
- **Day 1-2:** Domain stuck in "verification" status indefinitely  
- **Day 2:** Multiple deployment attempts - all failed
- **Day 2+:** Domain shows 404 errors despite successful SSL certificate generation

## TECHNICAL EVIDENCE OF FAILURE
```bash
curl -I https://turboratenow.com/
HTTP/2 404 
content-length: 9
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

**Root Cause:** Replit deployment system successfully generated SSL certificate but completely failed to route domain to application server.

## FINANCIAL IMPACT
- **Domain Service Fee:** Full refund demanded
- **Lost Revenue:** CPA campaign launch delayed 2+ days
- **Technical Resources:** Hours spent troubleshooting Replit infrastructure failure
- **Opportunity Cost:** Competitors gained market advantage during outage

## REQUIRED RESOLUTION
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Manual technical intervention to connect domain routing
2. **BILLING:** Full credit/refund for non-functional domain service
3. **ESCALATION:** Technical team review of deployment system failures
4. **TIMELINE:** Estimated resolution time for permanent fix

## CUSTOMER EXPECTATION
Domain service was purchased with expectation of immediate functionality. 2+ day failure for basic domain routing is completely unacceptable for a paid service.

**DEMAND:** Full billing credit + expedited technical resolution + service level guarantee

## NEXT STEPS
- Technical support escalation required
- Billing department notification for service credit
- Engineering team involvement for infrastructure fix
