# EMERGENCY CLOUDFLARE WORKER FIX

## CURRENT PROBLEM
- Worker deployment successful
- Domain DNS configured correctly  
- Error 522 connection timeouts persist
- Development URL may be unstable or changed

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS TO TRY

### Option 1: Test Worker URL Directly
First test if worker works: `https://turboratenow-proxy.bingham-derek.workers.dev`
If this shows landing page, DNS propagation is the issue.

### Option 2: Use Alternative Replit URL Format
Try updating worker with this URL instead:
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://cpa-bridge-booster-project--5000.repl.co'
```

### Option 3: Emergency Direct Connection
Temporarily bypass proxy and use direct Replit URL:
1. Change DNS back to A record: 34.111.179.208
2. Use working Replit URL directly until proxy resolves

### Option 4: Check Current URL from Logs
Look for any URL shown in server logs that responds to requests.

## STATUS
Testing these options now to identify root cause and get domain working.
