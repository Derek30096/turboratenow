# CLOUDFLARE REDIRECT SOLUTION
## Quick Fix for turboratenow.net

Since the direct A record isn't working with Replit's routing system, here's the immediate solution:

### Cloudflare Page Rules (Recommended)
1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Rules → Page Rules**
2. **Create Page Rule:**
   - URL: `turboratenow.net/*`
   - Setting: "Forwarding URL" 
   - Status Code: 301 (Permanent Redirect)
   - Destination: `https://cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek.replit.app/$1`

3. **Create Second Page Rule:**
   - URL: `www.turboratenow.net/*`
   - Setting: "Forwarding URL"
   - Status Code: 301 (Permanent Redirect) 
   - Destination: `https://cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek.replit.app/$1`

### Alternative: Cloudflare Workers (More Advanced)
Create a Worker with this code:
```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const newUrl = `https://cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek.replit.app${url.pathname}${url.search}`
  
  return Response.redirect(newUrl, 301)
}
```

### Expected Result
- turboratenow.net → redirects to working Replit URL
- Maintains clean domain in browser (after redirect)
- Works immediately (no waiting for routing fixes)
- Professional appearance for CPA campaigns

### Why This Works
- DNS points to Cloudflare
- Cloudflare handles the redirect
- User sees turboratenow.net initially
- Landing page loads from working Replit URL
- Perfect for affiliate marketing campaigns

This is the fastest way to get your domain live while bypassing Replit's routing issues.
