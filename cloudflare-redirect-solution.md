# Cloudflare Redirect Solution

## Immediate Fix: Make turboratenow.net Work Right Now

Since Replit's domain verification is failing (again), use Cloudflare Page Rules to redirect your domain to the working URL.

### Step 1: Login to Cloudflare Dashboard
- Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
- Select your turboratenow.net domain

### Step 2: Create Page Rule
1. Click "Rules" → "Page Rules"
2. Click "Create Page Rule"
3. Configure:
   - **URL Pattern**: `turboratenow.net/*`
   - **Setting**: "Forwarding URL"
   - **Status Code**: "301 - Permanent Redirect"
   - **Destination URL**: `https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app/$1`

### Step 3: Save and Test
- Click "Save and Deploy"
- Test: Visit turboratenow.net (should redirect to your working landing page)

## Result
- ✅ turboratenow.net works immediately
- ✅ Professional domain for CPA campaigns
- ✅ No dependency on Replit's broken domain service
- ✅ Can launch campaigns right now

## Later: Remove Redirect
Once/if Replit fixes their domain service, you can delete this redirect rule and use direct connection.

## Benefits
- **Immediate**: Works within 2 minutes
- **Reliable**: Cloudflare's infrastructure vs Replit's broken system
- **Professional**: Clean domain for affiliate campaigns
- **Flexible**: Easy to modify or remove later
