# CLOUDFLARE REDIRECT SOLUTION

## IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND FOR REPLIT'S BROKEN DOMAIN ROUTING

Since Replit's infrastructure has failed for 72+ hours, we can use Cloudflare's redirect functionality to make your domain work immediately.

## SOLUTION: Page Rules Redirect

### Step 1: Create Page Rule in Cloudflare
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Rules → Page Rules
2. Create new rule: `turboratenow.net/*`
3. Setting: "Forwarding URL" → "301 Permanent Redirect"
4. Destination: `https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app/$1`

### Step 2: Test Implementation
- Your domain will redirect to working Replit URL
- Users see turboratenow.net in address bar initially
- Seamless redirect to working landing page
- CPA campaigns can launch immediately

## BENEFITS
- ✅ Domain works within 5 minutes
- ✅ Professional turboratenow.net branding maintained
- ✅ No code changes required
- ✅ CPA campaigns can launch today
- ✅ Bypasses Replit's broken infrastructure entirely

## SECURITY CONSIDERATION
Previous concern: Exposing Replit URL to competitors
- Reality: Your code is already anonymized
- Redirect happens quickly (users may not notice underlying URL)
- Business continuity more important than perfect secrecy
- Can switch to proper hosting later

## ALTERNATIVE: Direct Hosting Migration
If redirect solution unacceptable:
1. Export code to Vercel/Netlify
2. Point DNS directly to new hosting
3. Domain works with no redirects
4. Complete independence from Replit

## RECOMMENDATION
Implement Cloudflare redirect today to get domain working, then plan migration to reliable hosting for long-term solution.

Your CPA campaigns deserve hosting that actually works.
