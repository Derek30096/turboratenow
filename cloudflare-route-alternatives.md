# CLOUDFLARE ROUTE ALTERNATIVES

## ROUTE PATTERN TROUBLESHOOTING

### Current Issue
Pattern `turboratenow.net/*` showing "Route pattern must include zone name" error

### Alternative Patterns to Try
1. `*turboratenow.net/*` (single asterisk prefix)
2. `turboratenow.net*` (simple wildcard)  
3. `https://turboratenow.net/*` (with protocol)
4. `turboratenow.net/**` (double asterisk)

### DNS Conflict Resolution
The CNAME record might be conflicting with Workers Route. Try:
1. Remove CNAME record: turboratenow.net → auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev
2. Add A record: turboratenow.net → 192.0.2.1 (placeholder)
3. Then add Workers Route

### Page Rules Alternative (Backup Solution)
If Workers Route continues failing:
1. Go to Rules → Page Rules
2. Pattern: `turboratenow.net/*`
3. Setting: Forwarding URL (301 Redirect)
4. Destination: `https://auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev/$1`

### Ultimate Fallback
Keep existing CNAME setup and accept the worker subdomain visibility as temporary solution until route works.
