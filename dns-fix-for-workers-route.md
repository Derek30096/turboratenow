# DNS FIX FOR WORKERS ROUTE

## PROBLEM
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error - Workers Route active but domain not resolving

## ROOT CAUSE
Workers Routes require a basic DNS record to exist before they can intercept traffic.
With completely empty DNS, the domain doesn't resolve at all.

## SOLUTION
Add a basic DNS record that Workers Route can override:

### Option 1: A Record (Recommended)
- **Type**: A
- **Name**: @ (or turboratenow.net)
- **Content**: 192.0.2.1 (placeholder IP)
- **Proxy Status**: Proxied (orange cloud)

### Option 2: AAAA Record
- **Type**: AAAA  
- **Name**: @ (or turboratenow.net)
- **Content**: 100::1 (placeholder IPv6)
- **Proxy Status**: Proxied (orange cloud)

## HOW IT WORKS
1. DNS record makes domain resolvable
2. Cloudflare proxy intercepts the request
3. Workers Route processes the request before reaching the IP
4. Worker serves the landing page content
5. Placeholder IP is never actually reached

## STEPS
1. Go back to DNS management for turboratenow.net
2. Click "Add record"
3. Add A record: @ â†’ 192.0.2.1 (Proxied)
4. Save and test turboratenow.net again
5. Workers Route will intercept and serve landing page
