# DNS PROPAGATION STATUS

## CURRENT SITUATION
- Workers Route: ✅ Active (turboratenow.net/* → auto-rates-comparison)
- DNS Record: ✅ Added (A record: 192.0.2.1, Proxied)
- Domain Status: ❌ Still showing DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN

## DNS PROPAGATION TIMING
- Local ISP: 5-15 minutes typical
- Global propagation: 15-60 minutes normal
- Full worldwide: Up to 24-48 hours maximum

## IMMEDIATE WORKING SOLUTION
While waiting for DNS propagation, you have a working anonymous solution:

**Current Setup Status:**
1. ✅ Beautiful CPA landing page working
2. ✅ Anonymous worker created (auto-rates-comparison) 
3. ✅ Workers Route properly configured
4. ✅ DNS foundation record added
5. ⏱️ Waiting for DNS propagation only

## VERIFICATION STEPS
Test different networks:
- Try mobile data vs WiFi
- Different browsers
- DNS lookup tools online

## EXPECTED TIMELINE
- Next 15-30 minutes: Should start working
- If still failing after 1 hour: Investigate further

## BACKUP OPTIONS
1. Keep using direct Replit URL for testing
2. Page Rules as alternative to Workers Route
3. Different DNS providers for faster propagation
