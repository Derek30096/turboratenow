# DNS TROUBLESHOOTING - turboratenow.net

## CURRENT STATUS
- Worker URL working: auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev ✅
- Domain status: turboratenow.net showing Error 522 ❌
- DNS updated: CNAME points to new worker ✅

## POSSIBLE CAUSES
1. **DNS Propagation Delay**: Can take up to 24-48 hours globally
2. **Cloudflare Cache**: Old DNS records cached in Cloudflare edge servers
3. **Worker Connection**: Domain routing different from direct worker access
4. **SSL Certificate**: Domain SSL might need regeneration

## DIAGNOSTIC STEPS
1. Check DNS propagation status using online tools
2. Clear Cloudflare cache for the domain
3. Verify CNAME record is correctly pointing to worker
4. Check if SSL certificate is valid for domain

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS
### Option 1: Wait for DNS Propagation
- Normal delay: 5-15 minutes to 24-48 hours
- Check periodically until resolved

### Option 2: Clear Cloudflare Cache
- Go to Cloudflare dashboard
- Navigate to Caching > Configuration
- Click "Purge Everything"

### Option 3: Verify DNS Settings
- Confirm CNAME record: turboratenow.net → auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev
- Ensure proxy status is "Proxied" (orange cloud)

## BACKUP PLAN
If domain continues failing:
- Use direct worker URL for immediate campaigns
- Consider alternative domain setup
- Document issue for potential Cloudflare support
