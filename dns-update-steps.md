# DNS UPDATE FOR ANONYMOUS WORKER

## CURRENT STATUS
- Old worker: turboratenow-proxy.bingham-derek.workers.dev (exposes personal info)
- New worker: auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev (anonymous)
- Domain: turboratenow.net (currently pointing to old worker)

## DNS UPDATE STEPS
1. Go to Cloudflare DNS for turboratenow.net
2. Edit the existing CNAME record
3. Change target from: turboratenow-proxy.bingham-derek.workers.dev
4. To new target: auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev
5. Keep proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)
6. Save changes

## RESULT
- turboratenow.net will use the new anonymous worker
- Landing page remains the same but with better security
- Worker name is now generic "auto-rates-comparison"

## REMAINING ISSUE
Still shows "bingham-derek" in subdomain - this is Cloudflare account limitation.
Final solution may require custom domain routing to completely hide personal info.
