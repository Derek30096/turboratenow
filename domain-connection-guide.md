# Connect turboratenow.net to Your Working Site

## Current Status
✓ Your CPA landing page is working perfectly
✓ Server routing configured for turboratenow.net
✓ DNS records already configured in Cloudflare

## Steps to Connect Domain

### 1. Access Replit Domain Management
- Go to your Replit dashboard
- Click on this project (cpa-bridge-booster-project)
- Look for "Domains" or "Custom Domain" in the settings

### 2. Add Custom Domain
- Click "Add Custom Domain" or "Connect Domain"
- Enter: `turboratenow.net`
- Choose "I'll configure DNS myself" (since you already have Cloudflare)

### 3. Required DNS Records (Already Done)
Based on your documentation, these should already be set in Cloudflare:
```
A Record: turboratenow.net → 34.111.179.208
TXT Record: replit-verify → [verification code]
```

### 4. Verification Process
- Replit will verify the DNS records
- This usually takes 5-15 minutes
- Status will show "Verifying" then "Active"

### 5. SSL Certificate
- Replit automatically provisions SSL certificates
- Your site will be available at https://turboratenow.net

## Expected Outcome
Once connected, turboratenow.net will show your beautiful CPA landing page with:
- Red urgency header
- Blue gradient background
- Auto insurance offer copy
- MaxBounty affiliate integration
- All tracking disabled (no billing charges)

## Troubleshooting
If verification fails:
1. Double-check DNS records in Cloudflare
2. Ensure A record points to: 34.111.179.208
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)
4. Try removing and re-adding the domain

Your site is ready - just need to connect the domain through Replit's interface!
