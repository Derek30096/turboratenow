# Replit Domain Support Request

## Issue Summary
**Domain:** turboratenow.com  
**Replit Project:** cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek  
**Issue:** Domain verification failed after 40+ minutes  
**Status:** "Not Found" error - domain not connecting to deployment  

## Timeline
- **Domain Added:** January 24, 2025 ~12:00 PM UTC
- **DNS Configured:** Cloudflare with correct A record (34.111.179.208) and TXT verification
- **Current Status:** 40+ minutes of "Verifying" - complete failure
- **Expected Resolution:** Should have worked within 5-15 minutes maximum

## Technical Details
- **DNS Records Confirmed Correct:** A record pointing to 34.111.179.208, TXT record for verification
- **Application Working:** Fully functional at cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek.replit.app
- **SSL Status:** Handshake occurring but hostname matching failing
- **Server Logs:** No domain requests reaching server (complete routing failure)

## Billing Concern
Customer should not be charged for domain service during this extended failure period. This is a Replit infrastructure issue, not a customer configuration problem.

## Requested Action
1. **Immediate:** Fix domain routing to connect turboratenow.com to deployment
2. **Billing:** Credit account for time domain service was non-functional
3. **Resolution:** Ensure domain works as advertised within reasonable timeframe

## Evidence
- DNS configuration verified correct in Cloudflare
- Application tested and working on Replit subdomain
- 40+ minute verification time far exceeds normal 5-15 minute window
- Multiple troubleshooting attempts with enhanced server routing failed

This is a paid service that should work immediately. Customer requires working domain for business use (CPA marketing campaign).
