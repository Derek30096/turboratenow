# Domain Verification Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
turboratenow.net is stuck in "Verifying" status longer than expected.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. DNS Propagation Delay
- TXT record may not be globally propagated yet
- Can take up to 48 hours in rare cases
- Usually resolves within 30-60 minutes

### 2. Cloudflare Proxy Status
- Ensure all records are "DNS only" (gray cloud)
- Proxied records (orange cloud) can interfere with verification

### 3. TTL Settings
- Lower TTL values speed up propagation
- Change TTL to 60 seconds for faster updates

### 4. Multiple A Records
- Ensure both @ and www point to same IP
- Remove any conflicting records

### 5. Replit Re-verification
- Sometimes manually triggering re-check helps
- Edit domain in Replit and save again

## Next Steps
1. Check if TXT record is globally visible
2. Verify all DNS settings are correct
3. Wait for natural propagation (most common solution)
4. Contact Replit if stuck after 2+ hours
