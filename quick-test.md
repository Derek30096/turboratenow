# Quick Domain Test Results

## DNS Status âœ…
- turboratenow.net A record: 34.111.179.208 
- www.turboratenow.net A record: 34.111.179.208
- DNS propagation: Complete

## Connection Status
- HTTP redirect: Working (301 to HTTPS)
- HTTPS connection: Established
- Current issue: 404 Not Found

## Likely Cause
The domain is connecting to Replit's infrastructure but may need to be added to the allowed hosts list, or there's a routing configuration issue.

## Next Steps
1. Test if it's working now with updated server code
2. If still 404, may need to add domain through Replit's deployment settings
3. Alternative: Create a simple redirect from Cloudflare

## Backup Plan
If direct connection doesn't work, we can set up Cloudflare proxy to forward to the working Replit URL.
