# Quick Domain Test Results

Testing turboratenow.net status to determine if Replit's infrastructure issues have been resolved.

## Test Commands
1. `curl -L https://turboratenow.net/` - Full page content test
2. `curl -I https://turboratenow.net/` - Headers only test

## Expected Results
- **SUCCESS**: Landing page content with "Most Drivers Overpay" text
- **FAILURE**: 404 errors or SSL certificate issues

## Current Status - CONFIRMED BROKEN
**Date/Time:** January 26, 2025 - 11:35 PM

**Test Results:**
- Main domain (turboratenow.net): 404 Error
- WWW subdomain: 404 Error  
- Direct index.html: 404 Error
- SSL Status: Working (no certificate errors)
- Routing Status: COMPLETELY BROKEN

**Conclusion:** 
Replit's domain routing infrastructure has failed for 72+ hours. SSL works but all requests return 404. This is confirmed infrastructure failure, not configuration issue.

**Evidence:** 
- DNS configuration perfect in Cloudflare
- Server application working on Replit subdomain
- SSL certificate generated successfully
- Problem is purely Replit's routing system
