# REPLIT BILLING DISPUTE DOCUMENTATION
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Service Failure:** Domain verification system completely broken for 4+ days

## TIMELINE OF SERVICE FAILURE
- **Day 1:** Domain purchased, DNS configured correctly
- **Day 2:** Verification stuck in "pending" state  
- **Day 3:** Still no verification despite perfect DNS
- **Day 4:** Customer reports continued failure
- **Day 5:** STILL BROKEN - 4+ days of paid service failure

## EVIDENCE OF CORRECT CONFIGURATION
- ✓ DNS records properly configured in Cloudflare
- ✓ A record: turboratenow.net → 34.111.179.208
- ✓ TXT record: replit-verify code present
- ✓ All technical requirements met

## BUSINESS IMPACT
- Unable to launch CPA marketing campaigns
- Professional domain unusable due to Replit failure
- Forced to use workarounds for basic paid functionality
- 4+ days of lost business opportunity

## BILLING DISPUTE DEMAND
1. **Full refund** for domain service charges
2. **Service credit** for 4+ days of system downtime
3. **Priority support** to resolve technical failure
4. **Escalation to management** for unacceptable service level

## ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
Customer forced to use Cloudflare Page Rules to bypass Replit's broken domain system.

This level of service failure is completely unacceptable for a paid service.
