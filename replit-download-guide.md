# HOW TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PROJECT FROM REPLIT

## METHOD 1: Three-Dot Menu (Most Common)
1. **Look for the "â‹¯" (three dots) menu** - Usually located:
   - Top right corner of the file explorer panel
   - Or top right of the main interface
   - Sometimes labeled as "More options" or "..."

2. **Click the three dots** and look for:
   - "Download as zip"
   - "Export project" 
   - "Download project"

## METHOD 2: File Menu
1. **Click "File" in the top menu bar**
2. **Look for "Download" or "Export" option**

## METHOD 3: Keyboard Shortcut
- Try **Ctrl+Shift+E** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+E** (Mac)

## METHOD 4: Right-Click Project Name
1. **Right-click on your project name** in the file explorer
2. **Look for download/export option**

## WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR:
The downloaded file will be named something like:
- `cpa-bridge-booster-project.zip`
- `workspace.zip` 
- Or similar

## IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE MENU:
Alternative approach - I can help you copy the key files manually:
1. Open each important file in Replit
2. Copy the contents
3. Create new files locally
4. This takes longer but works if download isn't available
