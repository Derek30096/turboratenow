# Replit Manual Domain Connection Guide

## Step 1: Click "Manually connect from another registrar"
This is the button visible in your Replit deployment dashboard.

## Step 2: Enter Your Domain
- Domain name: turboratenow.net
- This will give you specific DNS instructions from Replit

## Step 3: Expected DNS Instructions from Replit
Replit will likely provide:
- **CNAME record** pointing to your Replit app
- **TXT record** for domain verification
- **Specific instructions** for your domain registrar

## Step 4: Update Cloudflare DNS
Replace your current A records with Replit's instructions:
- Remove: A records to 34.111.179.208
- Add: CNAME and TXT records as instructed by Replit

## Step 5: Verification
- Replit will verify the DNS changes
- Domain should connect within 5-15 minutes
- Much more reliable than their broken automated system

## Why This Works Better
- Manual connection bypasses the failed automated system
- Replit provides exact DNS requirements
- Verification process is more reliable
- Your domain gets properly registered in their routing system

This should give you the same result as a working Replit domain purchase, but using your reliable Cloudflare-registered domain.
