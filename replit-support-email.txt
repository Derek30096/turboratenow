Subject: URGENT: Domain Service Complete Failure - Immediate Escalation Required

Dear Replit Support Team,

I am experiencing a critical domain service failure that has prevented my website from being accessible for over 48 hours despite multiple deployment attempts.

DOMAIN: turboratenow.com
REPL: cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek
STATUS: Complete routing failure after successful SSL certificate generation

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Domain purchased through Replit domain service 2+ days ago
- DNS configured correctly (A record: 34.111.179.208)
- SSL certificate: Generated successfully (HTTPS responses received)
- Routing: COMPLETELY FAILED (404 errors consistently)
- Application: Working perfectly on Replit subdomain
- Multiple deployments attempted: All failed to connect domain routing

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Unable to launch marketing campaigns due to non-functional domain
- Revenue loss from delayed website launch
- Paid domain service completely non-functional
- Customer trust issues from broken website links

EVIDENCE:
```
curl -I https://turboratenow.com/
HTTP/2 404 
content-length: 9
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

This is clearly a Replit infrastructure issue where:
1. SSL certificate generation succeeded
2. Domain routing to application server failed
3. Deployment system shows success but domain returns 404

REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Emergency manual routing configuration for turboratenow.com
2. Full billing credit for non-functional domain service
3. Technical team escalation to fix deployment routing system
4. Timeline for permanent resolution

This is a paid service that is completely non-functional. I need immediate escalation to your technical team for manual intervention.

Please provide:
- Emergency phone support number
- Technical team escalation
- Estimated resolution time
- Billing credit for service failure

This issue requires immediate resolution as it's preventing business operations.

Thank you for urgent attention to this critical issue.
