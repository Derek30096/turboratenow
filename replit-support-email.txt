Subject: URGENT: Domain Verification Failed After 40+ Minutes - Billing Issue

Dear Replit Support,

I am experiencing a critical issue with domain verification that has now exceeded 40 minutes with no resolution. This is completely unacceptable for a paid service.

ISSUE DETAILS:
- Domain: turboratenow.com
- Project: cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek
- Problem: Domain shows "Not Found" after 40+ minutes of "verification"
- DNS: Correctly configured in Cloudflare (A: 34.111.179.208, TXT verification)

TIMELINE:
- Domain added: ~12:00 PM UTC today
- Expected resolution: 5-15 minutes
- Actual status: 40+ minutes of failure
- Business impact: CPA marketing campaign delayed

TECHNICAL STATUS:
- Application works perfectly at: cpa-bridge-booster-binghamderek.replit.app
- DNS records verified correct
- SSL handshake occurring but hostname matching failing
- No domain requests reaching server (complete routing failure)

BILLING CONCERN:
I should NOT be charged for domain service during this extended failure period. This is clearly a Replit infrastructure issue, not a customer configuration problem.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUESTED:
1. Fix domain routing to connect turboratenow.com to my deployment
2. Credit my account for non-functional service time
3. Escalate to technical team for immediate resolution

This domain is needed for a business marketing campaign. 40+ minutes is far beyond any reasonable verification timeframe. Please resolve immediately and address the billing issue.

Domain: turboratenow.com

Thank you,
