Subject: URGENT: Second Domain Verification Failure - turboratenow.net Stuck for 1+ Hour

Dear Replit Support,

I'm experiencing a second critical domain verification failure that requires immediate escalation:

**Domain Details:**
- Domain: turboratenow.net (purchased through Cloudflare)
- Status: Stuck in "Verifying" for 1+ hour
- Method: Manual domain connection (bypassed automated system)
- DNS Records: Correctly configured and propagating

**Technical Evidence:**
- HTTPS connection: Working (SSL certificate generated)
- HTTP redirect: Working (301 to HTTPS)
- Response: 404 (domain connects but routing incomplete)
- DNS: A records point to 34.111.179.208, TXT verification record present

**Previous Issue:**
- turboratenow.com: Complete failure after 48+ hours
- Status: Still shows "(failed)" in dashboard
- This is the second domain purchased due to your service failure

**Business Impact:**
- CPA affiliate campaign launch delayed 3+ days
- Professional domain required for conversion optimization
- Time-sensitive marketing opportunity being lost

**Request:**
1. Immediate engineering escalation for turboratenow.net routing completion
2. Full billing credit for both failed domain services
3. Priority support due to repeat service failure

**Technical Status:**
- Application: Running perfectly on Replit URL
- Domain Infrastructure: SSL and DNS working
- Issue: Final routing step incomplete after 1+ hour

This is the second domain service failure in 3 days. I need immediate resolution and billing credits for the unacceptable service quality.

Please escalate to your engineering team immediately.
