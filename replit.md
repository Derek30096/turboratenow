# Auto Insurance Landing Page

## Overview

This is a single-page CPA (Cost Per Action) bridge landing page designed to pre-sell Champion Auto Insurance offers. The application is built as a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, with a focus on conversion optimization and user engagement.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Analytics**: Real-time visitor tracking with session management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Tables**: Users, visitors, click_events, leads for comprehensive analytics
- **Session Management**: Uses connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx and Vite integration
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for tracking visitor analytics and conversions

## Key Components

### Landing Page Structure
The main landing page (`client/src/pages/home.tsx`) follows a conversion-optimized structure:
1. **Hero Section**: Primary headline, subheadline, and main CTA button
2. **Value Proposition**: Three key benefits with icons
3. **Visual Section**: Trust-building imagery
4. **Secondary CTA**: Reinforcement section with additional call-to-action
5. **Footer**: Disclaimer and legal text

### UI Component System
- **shadcn/ui**: Comprehensive component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Custom Components**: Specialized components like `LoadingBar` for engagement
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Animation**: CSS transitions and scroll-triggered animations

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user management with username/password and timestamp fields
- **Visitors Table**: Session tracking with IP, user agent, referrer, and landing page data
- **Click Events Table**: CTA click tracking with types (hero_cta, secondary_cta, urgency_cta)
- **Leads Table**: Conversion tracking with email, zip code, and conversion values
- **Drizzle Configuration**: PostgreSQL dialect with automated schema migrations
- **Storage Interface**: DatabaseStorage class implementing comprehensive analytics methods

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Flow
1. User lands on homepage with immediate visual impact
2. Intersection Observer triggers animations as user scrolls
3. CTA buttons currently log interactions (placeholder for affiliate redirection)
4. React Query manages any future API state requirements

### Server-Side Flow
1. Express server handles static file serving and API routes
2. Vite middleware provides hot reload in development
3. Database operations abstracted through storage interface
4. Session management ready for user tracking if needed

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database Migration**: Drizzle kit handles schema migrations
4. **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL required for PostgreSQL connection

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with Express integration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across frontend and backend
- **Database**: Can use Neon PostgreSQL or local PostgreSQL instance
- **Replit Integration**: Configured with replit-specific plugins and banners

### Production Considerations
