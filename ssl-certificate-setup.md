# SSL CERTIFICATE SETUP FOR TURBORATENOW.NET

## CURRENT STATUS
- ✅ Domain resolving: turboratenow.net working
- ✅ Workers Route active: serving landing page
- ❌ SSL Certificate: showing "Not secure" - needs HTTPS

## CLOUDFLARE SSL CONFIGURATION

### Step 1: Check SSL Settings
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Select turboratenow.net domain
3. Click "SSL/TLS" in left sidebar
4. Check current SSL mode

### Step 2: Enable SSL Certificate
**Recommended Settings:**
- **SSL/TLS Mode**: "Full" or "Full (strict)"
- **Edge Certificates**: Should show "Active Certificate"
- **Always Use HTTPS**: Enable this setting

### Step 3: Force HTTPS Redirect
1. Go to "SSL/TLS" → "Edge Certificates"
2. Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
3. This forces HTTP → HTTPS redirect

### Step 4: Universal SSL
- Should be enabled by default
- If not active, click "Enable Universal SSL"
- Certificate provisioning takes 15-60 minutes

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS

### If SSL Still Not Working:
1. **Check Certificate Status**:
   - Go to SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates
   - Look for "Active Certificate" status
   - Should show "Universal SSL" as active

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Try private/incognito browser window

3. **Check DNS Proxy Status**:
   - DNS records must be "Proxied" (orange cloud)
   - Grey cloud = DNS only (no SSL)

4. **Wait for Propagation**:
   - SSL certificates can take 15-60 minutes to activate
   - Global propagation up to 24 hours in rare cases

## VERIFICATION
Once SSL is active, test:
- https://turboratenow.net should work with green lock
- http://turboratenow.net should redirect to HTTPS
- No "Not secure" warning in browser

## FALLBACK OPTIONS
If Cloudflare SSL fails:
1. Try "Flexible" SSL mode temporarily
2. Use Cloudflare Page Rules for HTTPS redirect
3. Consider Let's Encrypt certificate through hosting provider
