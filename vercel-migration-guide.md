## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS (30 Minutes Total)

### PHASE 1: Prepare Your Code for Export (5 minutes)

**Your React app is already perfect and portable. We just need to package it:**

1. **Download Project Files:**
   - Click "..." menu in Replit
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your computer

2. **Files You Need:**
   - `client/` folder (your React app)
   - `package.json` 
   - `vite.config.ts`
   - `tailwind.config.ts`
   - `tsconfig.json`
   - `components.json`

### PHASE 2: Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)

**Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)**
1. Create new GitHub repository
