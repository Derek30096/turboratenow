# CLOUDFLARE WORKER DEBUG & FIX

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Worker showing blank page - likely URL mismatch in proxy code

## CURRENT REPLIT URL
Based on logs: `https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app`
Alternative format: May need different subdomain format

## WORKER CODE UPDATE NEEDED
Replace line 7 in worker with correct URL:

**Current code:**
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app'
```

**Try this URL instead:**
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://84558308-661e-4d2e-89a3-c392a1fd57a3-00-2phr21a0sgnke.spock.replit.dev'
```

## STEPS TO FIX
1. Go back to Cloudflare worker editor
2. Change line 7 to use the Replit dev URL (from logs)
3. Deploy updated worker
4. Test again

## EXPLANATION
Replit apps can have multiple URL formats:
- Production: .replit.app
- Development: .spock.replit.dev 

The worker needs to proxy to whichever URL is currently active.
