# CLOUDFLARE WORKER DEBUG & FIX

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Worker showing blank page - likely URL mismatch in proxy code

## CURRENT REPLIT URL
Based on logs: `https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app`
Alternative format: May need different subdomain format

## WORKER CODE UPDATE NEEDED
Replace line 7 in worker with correct URL:

**Current code:**
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app'
```

**Try this URL instead:**
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://84558308-661e-4d2e-89a3-c392a1fd57a3-00-2phr21a0sgnke.spock.replit.dev'
```

## CURRENT ISSUE - Connection Timeout (Error 522)
The Replit development URL likely changed when server restarted.

## STEPS TO FIX
1. Check current server logs for new URL
2. Update worker line 7 with current URL from logs
3. Deploy updated worker
4. Test domain again

## SOLUTION: Use Production URL Instead
Better solution: Use the stable production URL instead of development URL:
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://cpa-bridge-booster-project.replit.app'
```

## CURRENT STATUS: Still Connection Timeout
Production URL not responding - need to check deployment status.

## IMMEDIATE FIX: Use Current Development URL
Worker should use the current working development URL from server logs:
```javascript
const targetUrl = 'https://84558308-661e-4d2e-89a3-c392a1fd57a3-00-2phr21a0sgnke.spock.replit.dev'
```

## EXPLANATION
Replit apps can have multiple URL formats:
- Production: .replit.app
- Development: .spock.replit.dev 

The worker needs to proxy to whichever URL is currently active.
