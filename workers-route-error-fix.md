# WORKERS ROUTE ERROR TROUBLESHOOTING

## COMMON ROUTE ERRORS AND FIXES

### Error 1: Route Pattern Issues
**Problem**: Invalid route pattern format
**Solution**: Try these patterns:
- `turboratenow.net/*` (without asterisk prefix)
- `*turboratenow.net/*` (with single asterisk)
- `turboratenow.net*` (simple wildcard)

### Error 2: Worker Not Found
**Problem**: Worker dropdown shows empty or error
**Solution**: 
- Refresh page and try again
- Ensure auto-rates-comparison worker is deployed
- Check worker is in same Cloudflare account

### Error 3: Zone Permissions
**Problem**: Permission denied for zone
**Solution**:
- Ensure you have admin access to turboratenow.net domain
- Worker and domain must be in same Cloudflare account

### Error 4: Conflicting DNS Records
**Problem**: Existing CNAME conflicts with route
**Solution**:
- Remove CNAME record pointing to worker subdomain
- Route will handle the traffic instead

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

### Option 1: Simpler Route Pattern
Try just: `turboratenow.net/*` (no leading asterisk)

### Option 2: Page Rules (Fallback)
If Workers Route fails:
1. Go to Rules â†’ Page Rules
2. Create rule: turboratenow.net/*
3. Setting: Forwarding URL (301)
4. Destination: https://auto-rates-comparison.bingham-derek.workers.dev/$1

### Option 3: Custom Domain (Enterprise)
For complete anonymity, consider upgrading to Workers custom domain feature.
