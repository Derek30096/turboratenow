## WORKERS ROUTE CONFIGURATION STEPS

### Step 1: Navigate to Routes
From your current Cloudflare Workers & Pages screen:
1. You should see "Bindings" section with "Add binding" option
2. Look for "Routes" tab or section
3. Or go to your domain dashboard: Cloudflare ‚Üí turboratenow.net ‚Üí Workers Routes

### Step 2: Add Route
Configure the route:
- **Route Pattern**: `turboratenow.net/*`
- **Worker**: `auto-rates-comparison`
- **Zone**: turboratenow.net

### Step 3: Remove CNAME Record
After route is working:
1. Go to DNS settings for turboratenow.net
2. Delete the CNAME record pointing to worker subdomain
3. Add A record pointing to Cloudflare proxy IPs (or keep CNAME to domain only)

## RESULT
- turboratenow.net will serve landing page directly
- No worker subdomain exposed
- Complete anonymity achieved
- Professional domain for campaigns

## ALTERNATIVE IF ROUTES NOT VISIBLE

1. Go to main Cloudflare dashboard
2. Select turboratenow.net domain
3. Navigate to Workers Routes from domain settings
4. Add route there instead
